# Digit-Recognizer
This application recognizes hand-written digits from 0-9 and labels them correctly on basis of certain characteristics. This is an example of using Neural Networks and Deep Learning.

This notebook depicts the use of **Deep Learning** technique - **Artificial Neural Networks**. The networks are built using **Keras** Library and hyperparameter tuning is also performed to find best model parameters for this use-case using **Keras Tuner's Random Search**. The the model's performance is analysed using Confusion Matrix and Classification Report.
